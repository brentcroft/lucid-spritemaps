This kit depends on **tensorflow**, **lucid**, **copy**, **json**, **math**, **numpy**, **os**, **pandas**, **PIL**, & **time**


This kit comprises:

1. A **graphs** directory containing one series of frozen graph instances:<br>
    eb_12_v07_480x270_01b:  [ "100k", "500k" ]

    
2. A **lib** directory containing Python modules.


3. A **vis** directory containing a working example.

Everything happens in the **vis** directory.

See the README.md file there for further details.
